     <p>Visual design plays an important role in the success of web presence and is equally important for both blogs and web stores. As an example of visual design, photo galleries are a popular way of integrating images into a website, allowing users to see several images clearly at once. Moreover, photo galleries let you better manage images in your websites, and image slideshows help you to showcase your images to the public (KS). </p>
