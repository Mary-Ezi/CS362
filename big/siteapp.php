<ul id="listul">

Users mostly remember the company’s name and not the specific URL. Therefore, if you enter the company name in the search box, the browser will show search results for the query. In this case, there is no guarantee that the site of the company will be first on the search list, which means some of the traffic will go to competitors.  </li>
